# cm

A **c**onfig **m**anager.

## What?

A script that helps you manage your machine configs (dotfiles, installed software, other configuration files). You can think of it as a dotfiles manager that allows you to specify how to install and configure your favorite software.

`cm` works on the concept of formulae (akin to homebrew). When you manage a dotfile using `cm`, you can also specify how to install and configure the software that uses the dotfile.

## Usage

See [help](./help/index).

## Adding `cm` to your dotfiles repo

You can add `cm` as a submodule.
```
git submodule add https://github.com/1ntEgr8/cm
```

## Why is it in bash?

Because bash is pretty chad.
