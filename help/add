cm-add

Create a formula and add paths to it

USAGE:
    ./cm add --formula <formula-name>
        Creates a formula named <formula-name>, where <formula-name> is a '/'
        delimited string. Creates intermediate directories as required. 

        For example,
        
        $ ./cm add --formula my/editor/vim

        will create the following directory structure

        my
        └── editor
            └── vim
                └── formula

    ./cm add [<path> ...] <formula-name>
        Adds files/directories to <formula-name>. No symlinks created.

    ./cm add --link [<path> ...] <formula-name>
        Adds files/directories to to <formula-name> and symlinks it. Records
        the link in the 'links' file of <formula-name>, which is created if it
        doesn't exist.

OPTIONS:
    -f, --formula <formula-name>    Creates a formula <formula-name>
    -l, --link                      Symlinks the added file

NOTES:
    The 'links' file of a formula records symlinks to files in the formula.

    Each line is formatted as:

    absolute/path/to/symlink -> absolute/path/to/file

    Since the file is autogenerated, it is recommended that you DO NOT edit it
    manually. If you do wish to add a link manually, remember to use absolute
    paths.
