cm-edit

Edit the declaration of a formula

USAGE:
    ./cm edit <formula-name>
        Opens "<formula-name>/formula" in vim for editing

NOTES:
    Every formula has to implement two functions:

    install       Installs any required software for the formula
    configure     Post-install configuration

    There are convenience variables declared in 'env'. Some examples
    include $bin_install (the command used to install binaries), and
    $app_install (the command used to install applications). The full list
    can be found in 'env'
