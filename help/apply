cm-apply

Applies the symlinks recorded in the 'links' file of a formula

USAGE:
    ./cm apply [<formula-name> ...]
        Creates the symlinks declared in '<formula-name>/links' for each
        formula. If a symlink is already present, it will unlink it first, and
        then link again.

    ./cm apply --copy [<formula-name> ...]
        Copies (and NOT symlink) files in '<formula-name> to the locations
        declared in the 'links' file of the formula.

    ./cm apply --dry-run [<formula-name> ...]
        Lists the symlinks that will be created

OPTIONS:
    -c, --copy      Tells `cm` to perform a copy, and not a symlink
    --dry-run       Dry-run of the apply operation
