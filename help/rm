cm-rm

USAGE:
    ./cm rm [path ...]
        Attempts to remove files/directories
 
NOTES:
    If the item to be removed has a link in ./links, cm will ask if you
    want to get rid of the symlink or leave a copy at that location. This
    is done so as to avoid leaving broken symlinks in the system.
