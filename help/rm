cm-rm

Removes files/directories tracked using `cm`.

USAGE:
    ./cm rm --dry-run [path ...]
        Lists files/directories that will be removed.
    
    ./cm rm [path ...]
        Attempts to remove files/directories
 
NOTES:
    If the path to be removed has a symlink recorded in the 'links' file of a
    formula, `cm` will ask if you want to get rid of the symlink or leave a
    copy at that location. This is done so as to avoid leaving broken symlinks
    in the system.
